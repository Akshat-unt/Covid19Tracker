# python-covid19-notifier
## My first Python project - Covid19 Notifier.

This little app gives you an opportunity to enter a country's name and receive some information about total cases of Covid19 in a particular country (also number of deaths, recovered cases, active cases etc.).

## Preview

## The data is fetched from [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc).

### You might run into errors running this app on Mac due to plyer library errors. I suggest you using then "python3 -m pip install git+http://github.com/kivy/pyobjus" in your terminal.

 You also can download statistics saved in a PDF file. There are stored plots with the data for a country that was chosen to create a PDF.

## Have fun!
